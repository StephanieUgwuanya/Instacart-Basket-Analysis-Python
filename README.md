<h1>Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Python</h1>

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 
My analysis entailed performing initial exploratory analysis on their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

<h1>Key Questions & Objectives</h1>

<h2>Sales Teams Questions & Objectives</h2>

<b>● The busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? Which departments have the highest frequency of product order.</b>

<h2>Marketing Team Questions & Objectivess</h2>

<b>● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?

- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?</b>
